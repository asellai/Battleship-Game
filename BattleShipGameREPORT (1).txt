Battleship Game Report 
Author: Aibek kyzy Asel  


1. Project Overview  
This project implements a simplified Battleship game on a 7x7 grid. The player guesses the positions of randomly placed ships, aiming to sink them all. Ships are hidden, and feedback ("Hit," "Miss," or "Sunk") is provided for each guess.  



2. Key Features  
-Player Input: Row and column guesses.  
-Random Ship Placement:  
  - 1 ship (length 3), 2 ships (length 2), 4 ships (length 1).  
  - Ensures no overlap or adjacency between ships.  
-Game Board: Tracks hits (X), misses (O), and hidden ships (~).  



3. Challenges  
1. Valid Ship Placement: Preventing overlaps and ensuring no ships touch, even at corners. Solved by checking all neighboring cells.  
2. Feedback for "Sunk" Ships: Simplified by checking surrounding cells after a hit.  



4. Websites Used
-ChatGPT: Helped simplify functions and algorithms.  
-cplusplus.com: For syntax and examples of vectors and file handling.  
-GeeksforGeeks: Referenced for random number generation and validating ship placement.  
-Cyberforum.ru: Inspiration for simplifying conditions using compact logic.
